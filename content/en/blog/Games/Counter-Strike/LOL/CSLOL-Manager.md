## Introduction

In this blog, we will explore how to customize your League of Legends (LoL) skins effortlessly using CSLOL Manager. You won't need to use any complex commands; it's all about user-friendly customization.

### What is CSLOL Manager?

CSLOL Manager allows you to apply custom skins created by the community to your League of Legends client. However, it's important to note that these skins are only visible to you; other players won't see your modified skins. In essence, it's a client-side modification that lets you personalize your LoL experience.

### Why Customize Your Skins?

League of Legends has evolved over time, and for some players, the nostalgia of the past versions still holds a special place. Customizing your skins can help recreate that old-school LoL experience, allowing you to relive the game's earlier days. It's not just about winning or losing; it's about cherishing the memories.

However, it's important to understand that the official developers won't revert to old skins. For them, progress means moving forward, and the past is left behind. But with CSLOL Manager, you have the power to modify LoL to your heart's content. Once you've created your desired skins, CSLOL Manager makes it easy to apply them.

### Is There a Risk of Being Banned?

Changing champion skins in League of Legends does come with some uncertainty. It's about altering the visual elements of the game, which could potentially affect the game's outcome. Riot Games generally allows skin changes that don't impact gameplay.

However, there's a slight risk of account suspension in some cases. To stay safe, avoid changing skins that you've paid for. Many players, including the author, have changed skins for years without facing any bans, so it's generally a safe practice.

### Is CSLOL Manager Safe?

CSLOL Manager is an open-source program, and you can even build it yourself from the source code. Using it this way is considered safer. As for the skins themselves, it depends on your trust level. You can test files for viruses if you have the means, as CSLOL Manager serves as a convenient way to download these skins. The files are hosted on platforms like MediaFire, so exercise caution based on your level of trust.

Now, let's delve into the steps to change your skins.

## Step 1: Install CSLOL Manager and Run the Program

## Impressions

Customizing League of Legends skins to resemble the old-school style brings back fond memories. Imagine Back to 2014 , with an item called "Deathfire Grasp," playing as LeBlanc and executing the perfect combo to obliterate every opponent: `<Deathfire Grasp><Q><R><W><E>`. It didn't matter if they were a tank; it was a one-shot wonder. 

Those days are long gone, but they remain preserved in my cherished memories. Haha ...
