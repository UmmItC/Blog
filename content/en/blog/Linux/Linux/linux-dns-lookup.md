## What is Nameserver?

Name servers stand as the bedrock of the Domain Name System (DNS), housing authoritative information about domain names. In this guide, we delve into the world of DNS operations, unraveling the hierarchical arrangement of name servers that facilitate the translation of domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.

## Grasping DNS Record Types

Before we plunge into the command intricacies, let's review common DNS record types:

- **A Record (Address Record):** Specifies the IPv4 address of a host.
- **AAA Record (IPv6 Address Record):** Specifies the IPv6 address of a host.
- **NS Record (Name Server Record):** Maps a domain name to a list of authoritative DNS servers.
- **MX Record (Mail Exchange Record):** Maps a domain name to a list of mail exchange servers.
- **PTR Record (Reverse Lookup Record):** Maps an IP address to a specific host.
- **CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record):** Creates aliases pointing to other names or subdomains.
- **SOA Record (Start of Authority Record):** Contains essential information about a DNS zone.
- **TXT Record (Text Record):** Provides text information to sources outside the domain.
- **SPF Record (Sender Policy Framework):** Verifies authorized mail servers for email authenticity.
- **DKIM Record (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** Provides encryption authentication for email.

## Installation on Arch-Based Linux

For those on Arch-Based Linux distributions, the first step is to ensure you have the necessary tools. You can swiftly install the `dnsutils` package, which includes essential commands such as `nslookup` and `dig`. Execute the following command to install the package:

```shell
sudo pacman -S dnsutils
```

With the tools in place, let's proceed to configure DNS servers.

## Harnessing `nslookup` for DNS Queries

The `nslookup` command emerges as a potent tool for querying DNS records. Utilize it by entering `nslookup` followed by the domain name. For instance, to retrieve the IP address linked with a domain:

```shell
nslookup example.com
```

## Employing `dig` for Comprehensive DNS Queries

The `dig` command furnishes comprehensive DNS record information. To retrieve intricate DNS details, deploy:

```shell
dig example.com
```

However, if you seek a swift and concise outcome, append `+short` to the command:

```shell
dig example.com +short
```

## Case Study: Fetching MX Records

To retrieve the mail exchange (MX) records for a domain, engage `nslookup`:

```shell
nslookup -query=mx example.com
```

Alternatively, use `dig`:

```shell
dig example.com MX
```

## Checking Your DNS Configuration

To easily verify DNS information for a site, you can use [www.nslookup.io](https://www.nslookup.io/). This online tool allows you to perform DNS lookups and gather information about a domain's DNS configuration effortlessly.

## In Conclusion

Venturing into DNS records using `nslookup` and `dig` imparts valuable insights into a domain's configuration. Whether investigating IP addresses, mail exchange servers, or other DNS records, these commands empower you to fathom the intricate relationships between domain names and various network resources. By harnessing the capabilities of `nslookup` and `dig`, you embark on a journey of profound understanding within the complex realm of DNS, enhancing your network troubleshooting and management prowess.
