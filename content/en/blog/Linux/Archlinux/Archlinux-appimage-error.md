## dlopen() Error with Appimage

If you encounter a "dlopen() error" when trying to use an Appimage, specifically related to loading "libfuse.so.2," you can resolve this issue by installing the necessary components. This error is often seen when working with applications that rely on FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) features.

To fix this problem, follow these steps:

1. Install `fuse2` Using pacman:

   Open your terminal and run the following command to install `fuse2`:

   ```shell
   sudo pacman -S fuse2
   ```

2. Install `fuse` and `squashfuse` Using yay:

   If you're using the yay AUR helper, you can install `fuse` and `squashfuse` packages:

   ```shell
   yay -S fuse squashfuse
   ```

These steps should help resolve the dlopen() error related to libfuse.so.2 when using the Appimage.
