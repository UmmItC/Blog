## 10. Final step - using VGA Display

For Windows, you should use the "VGA" Video Model to switch your monitor.

To do this, power off your VM and then switch to the VGA Video Model. After that, switch back to "HDMI2," and you will see your Windows 10 is working on your GPU-Display and not on the Virtual monitor.

By using the VGA Video Model, you can ensure that your VM utilizes the GPU-Display for better graphics performance and display capabilities.

![VGA](/blog/linux/dual-gpu-passthrough/part7/VGA.png)

## 11. Passthrough USB and Mouse

You might notice that you can't use the mouse and keyboard because you haven't enabled passthrough for them yet. To resolve this, simply add their respective devices to the VM, and they will function correctly.

Enabling passthrough for the mouse and keyboard allows the virtual machine to directly access these devices, providing seamless input functionality and better user experience within the VM.

![Mouse passthrough](/blog/linux/dual-gpu-passthrough/part7/Mouse_passthrough.png)
![Keyboard passthrough](/blog/linux/dual-gpu-passthrough/part7/Keyboard_passthrough.png)

## 12. Optimize CPU Configuration

It's recommended to use physical CPU cores instead of virtual CPU (vCPU) for improved performance.

By default, virtual machines are configured with vCPUs. To enhance speed, change this setting to utilize the actual physical CPU cores. Access this configuration by following the steps illustrated in the image below:

![CPU using](/blog/linux/dual-gpu-passthrough/part7/Speed-up-cpu.png)

By making this adjustment, your virtual machine will leverage the full potential of your physical CPU cores, resulting in improved performance and responsiveness.

## 13. Automatic Suspend

Since you have already enabled passthrough for your mouse and keyboard, your computer may automatically go into idle mode after being inactive for up to 15 minutes. This could lead to a system crash, so it's crucial to disable the "When idle"  Automatic Suspend setting.

In the GNOME desktop environment, you can access this setting as demonstrated in the image below:

![Power setting idle](/blog/linux/dual-gpu-passthrough/part7/Power_setting_idle.png)

This setting is essential to ensure stable and continuous use of your VM. If you don't change it, your host machine may shut down automatically, causing the VM to stop functioning as well.

Please remember to disable this feature to prevent any interruptions during your VM usage.


## Conclusion: Ready to Go!

Congratulations, you've successfully set up your virtual machine with hardware passthrough. Now, you can seamlessly switch your monitor to HDMI2 and start enjoying your virtual machine.
