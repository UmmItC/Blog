## Introduction

Virtualization has become an essential tool for developers, sysadmins, and enthusiasts to create and manage virtual machines efficiently. Virt-Manager, a popular open-source virtualization application, provides a user-friendly interface for managing virtual machines. However, users sometimes encounter issues with Network Address Translation (NAT) in Virt-Manager. In this blog post, we will explore why NAT might not be working as expected in Virt-Manager and provide solutions and workarounds to address these issues.

### What problem?

Are you unsure why Network Address Translation (NAT) isn't functioning as expected? the IP ADDRESS of your VM system  isn't being displayed. Normally, this information should be displayed accurately. The fact that it's not working as expected suggests there may be an issue with your computer.

### Understanding NAT in Virt-Manager

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a common networking technique used in virtualization to allow virtual machines to access the internet and communicate with other devices on the local network. When a VM is set up with NAT, it shares the host's IP address and appears as a single device on the network. This enables internet access for the VM and makes it accessible to other devices on the same local network.

Common NAT Issues:

1. **VPN Usage:**
   
   One of the common reasons why NAT might not work in Virt-Manager is VPN usage. When you are using a VPN on your host system, it can alter network settings and disrupt NAT functionality within Virt-Manager. VPNs are designed to protect your privacy by tunneling all traffic through a secure server, including your virtual machine's network traffic.

   **Solution:** To resolve this issue, you can adjust your VPN settings to allow `local networking sharing`. This option, available in many VPN clients, enables your VM to be visible on the local network, ensuring proper NAT functionality. By enabling local networking sharing, you allow your VM to communicate with other devices on the same LAN.

2. **Firewall or Security Software:**

   Sometimes, firewall software or security settings on your host system may block or restrict NAT functionality. These security measures might prevent the VM from accessing the internet or being accessible to other devices on the local network.

   **Solution:** Review your firewall and security software settings to ensure they are not interfering with NAT. Create exceptions or rules to allow traffic from the virtual machine to pass through the host system.

3. **Virt-Manager Configuration:**

   Incorrect configuration settings within Virt-Manager can also lead to NAT issues. Double-checking your VM's network settings, such as the NAT mode, can help identify and resolve problems.

   **Solution:** In Virt-Manager, go to the network settings of your VM and verify that it is configured to use NAT. Ensure that no conflicting network configurations are present.

4. **Network Disruption:**

   Sometimes, network disruptions on your host system, such as changes in IP address assignments or network interface configurations, can affect NAT functionality in Virt-Manager.

   **Solution:** If you suspect network disruptions, restart your host system and your virtual machine. This can help reestablish network configurations and resolve NAT issues.

## TL;DR

ensure that you can use local network sharing and that you are not being blocked by any program's default settings. Afterthat restart your system (VM) should be working. (As shown in the image below):

## Conclusion

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a vital feature in virtualization, enabling virtual machines to access the internet and communicate with other devices on the local network. When NAT issues arise in Virt-Manager, it can be frustrating, but they are often solvable.

To troubleshoot and resolve NAT problems, consider factors like VPN usage, firewall settings, Virt-Manager configurations, and network disruptions. By addressing these issues and making necessary adjustments, you can ensure that NAT works seamlessly within Virt-Manager, allowing your virtual machines to function as intended.
