## Introduction

In the world of virtualization, Virt-Manager with QEMU/KVM stands out as a versatile and user-friendly option. It not only allows you to create and manage virtual machines effortlessly but also offers a neat feature for capturing screenshots directly from your VMs. Whether you want to save a memorable moment or document an issue, taking screenshots within Virt-Manager is a valuable tool. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process.

## Advantages of using the built-in?

If you directly screenshot your current screen, one problem is that your windows will also screenshot along with it, so this is certainly one way to decide what method you should use to screenshot, and it seems to be your situation.

## Step 1: Open Your Virtual Machine

Begin by launching Virt-Manager and opening the virtual machine (VM) from which you want to capture a screenshot. Ensure that the VM is powered on and running.
