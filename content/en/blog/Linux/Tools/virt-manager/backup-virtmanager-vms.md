## Virt-manager

Your virt-manager virtual machines are essential assets, and having a solid backup plan is crucial. Fortunately, creating backups and restoring them is a straightforward process. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to backup and restore your virt-manager virtual machines on your Arch Linux system.

### Step 1: Backup XML Configuration

1. Locate the XML configuration files of your virtual machines. These files contain all the essential configuration details.

   ```shell
   /etc/libvirt/qemu/
   ```

2. Identify the name of the virtual machine you want to back up. You can use the following command to list all available virtual machines:

   ```shell
   sudo virsh list --all
   ```

3. Dump the XML configuration of your chosen virtual machine into a new XML file:

   ```shell
   sudo virsh dumpxml vm_name > vm_name.xml
   ```

   Replace `vm_name` with the actual name of your virtual machine.

### Step 2: Backup qcow2 Disk Image

1. Locate the qcow2 disk image files of your virtual machines. These files contain the actual system files.

   ```shell
   /var/lib/libvirt/images/
   ```

2. Copy the qcow2 disk image file of your chosen virtual machine to your backup location:

   ```shell
   sudo cp /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm_name.qcow2 backup_location/
   ```

   Replace `vm_name` with the name of your virtual machine and `backup_location` with the desired backup directory.

### Step 3: Restore Backup

1. Move the backed-up qcow2 disk image file to the original directory:

   ```shell
   sudo mv backup_location/vm_name.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/
   ```

2. Move the backed-up XML configuration file to the original directory:

   ```shell
   sudo mv backup_location/vm_name.xml /etc/libvirt/qemu/
   ```

3. Define the virtual machine using the restored XML configuration file:

   ```shell
   sudo virsh define --file /etc/libvirt/qemu/vm_name.xml
   ```

### Conclusion

Backing up and restoring virt-manager virtual machines on Arch Linux is a vital practice to safeguard your valuable data and configurations. By following these steps, you can ensure that your virtual machines remain secure and recoverable, even in the face of unexpected issues. Always remember to regularly update your backups and test the restoration process to maintain a reliable backup strategy.
