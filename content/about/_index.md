## Who are you?

Hello, I'm UmmIt. I'm a student and a GNU/Linux enthusiast. Also a FOSS user. I blog for fun and interest.

## Why did you start this blog?

I started this blog to share my experiences with GNU/Linux and other technologies. I also want to help people who are new to GNU/Linux and want to learn more about it.

Also, people who want to search for solutions to their problems. As my view point, there are many blogs that are not transparent and contain a lot of ads, and the content is not clear and easy to understand. For these reasons, I started this blog to provide clear and easy-to-understand content ***without ads***.

### Blog in general
