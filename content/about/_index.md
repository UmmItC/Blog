Hello, I'm UmmIt. I'm a student and a GNU/Linux enthusiast, as well as a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) user. I blog for fun and out of interest, using this platform to write articles and share my experiences—let's say my knowledge and notes.

>***I am particularly interested in GNU/Linux and ethical hacking.***

## Which kind of user am I?

I have been using GNU/Linux for over six years and have tried around 25 different distributions. However, I generally use four distributions for different purposes:

- **Arch Linux** (Daily Driver)
- **Debian** (VPS Server)
- **Raspberry Pi OS** (Mini Home Server)
- **Kali Linux** (Cyber Security Learning)
- **Gentoo** (Used occasionally, depending on my mood)
- **NixOS** (Learning; it’s truly a mind-blowing distro)

In short, apt, pacman, nix, and emerge :)

I also have a KVM-based ReviOS Windows 10 VM for gaming vm, but I rarely use it and am considering removing it.

## Why Did I Start This Blog?

I started this blog to share my experiences with GNU/Linux and other technologies. I also want to help those who are new to GNU/Linux and eager to learn more about it. Additionally, I aim to provide solutions for people searching for answers to their problems. In my view, many blogs lack transparency, are filled with ads, and present content that is not clear or easy to understand. For these reasons, I created this blog to offer clear and easy-to-understand content ***without ads***.

### Blog Overview

This blog focuses on GNU/Linux and technology. I will share my experiences and knowledge about GNU/Linux and other technologies, along with tips and tricks I have learned over the years. I will also provide tutorials.
