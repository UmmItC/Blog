## Who are you?

I'm an Arch Linux & Gentoo user. Also a FOSS user. I blog for fun and interest.

## Why this blog?

This blog is all about sharing my experiences. Like how to install arch linux. well, there is a lot of documentation out there, but there is too much to read and think about how to do it. So I wrote a blog post to make it easier for you to follow along.

### Blog in general

90% of the time I will also be writing about Linux. The other 10% is games, windows, mac.

### Favourite animal

Penguin for sure. really cute :3

### Core

- Hugo for SSG and blowfish theme.
- Umami for web analytics

### Privacy policy

I use [umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) to track some content for me. Also, cloudflare for CDN. and I don't have the cloudflare web analytics enabled. And that's it.

But basically, using ublock origin or something else that just blocks this thing. and if you don't belive me, press your F12 to see the network active analysis :)
